# AI Usage Report

**Student:** Yousef Alhadlaq  
**Course:** SWE363 - Web Programming  
**Date:** December 2024

## Overview

I built this portfolio website mostly on my own. I did use Claude AI occasionally for help, but the majority of the work was done by me.

## My Contribution vs AI

**My work (about 80%):**

- Designed the overall look and layout
- Wrote most of the HTML structure
- Created the CSS styling and animations
- Built the JavaScript functionality
- Debugged and fixed all issues
- Tested on different devices and browsers
- Customized everything to fit my vision

**AI assistance (about 20%):**

- Helped with some syntax I wasn't sure about
- Suggested a few modern CSS techniques
- Explained how to connect to the GitHub API
- Helped troubleshoot a couple of bugs

## How I Actually Built This

I started with a basic HTML structure based on what I learned in class. The CSS I wrote myself, looking up specific properties when I needed to. For JavaScript, I used my notes from class and some online documentation.

When I got stuck on the GitHub API, I asked Claude how fetch() works with async/await. It gave me an example, and I adapted it to my project.

Most of the time, I was coding on my own. AI was more like a reference when I needed clarification.

## What I Learned

- CSS Grid and Flexbox (practiced a lot)
- JavaScript event handling
- Working with APIs
- Responsive design principles
- How to organize a web project

## Why This Is My Work

1. I understand every line of code in this project
2. I made all the design decisions
3. I chose what features to include
4. I wrote the logic for filtering and sorting projects
5. I created the form validation myself
6. I debugged everything when things didn't work

If you asked me to explain any part of the code, I could do it easily because I wrote it.

## Final Note

Using AI occasionally is like using Stack Overflow or documentation - it helps when you're stuck, but the actual building and problem-solving is still done by me.
