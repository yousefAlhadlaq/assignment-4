## 4. What I Did Myself

### Design Decisions

- Chose the color scheme (purple/blue gradient)
- Decided on the layout and section order
- Selected which features to include
- Designed the user experience flow

### Content Creation

- Wrote all personal information and bio
- Created project descriptions
- Defined skill levels and categories
- Chose images and assets

### Customization

- Modified colors and spacing to my preference
- Adjusted animation timings
- Changed validation rules for the form
- Configured the GitHub username and settings

### Testing & Debugging

- Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Tested on mobile devices
- Fixed responsive design issues
- Debugged JavaScript errors

### Project Setup

- Created the folder structure
- Set up Git repository
- Deployed to GitHub Pages
- Organized all assets

## 5. What AI Helped With

### HTML Development

I asked Claude to help me create a semantic HTML5 structure. It provided the basic skeleton, and I modified it to add my content and adjust the sections.

**Example prompt I used:**

> "Help me create an HTML structure for a portfolio with hero, about, skills, projects, and contact sections"

### CSS Styling

AI helped with the responsive grid layout and CSS variables system. I then customized the colors, fonts, and spacing myself.

**What AI provided:**

- CSS variable structure
- Media query breakpoints
- Flexbox and Grid layouts
- Basic animation keyframes

**What I changed:**

- Color values
- Spacing units
- Font choices
- Hover effects

### JavaScript Functionality

Claude showed me how to implement certain features I wasn't sure about:

1. **GitHub API Integration** - I didn't know how to use fetch() with async/await. AI explained the concept and gave me a starting point.

2. **Intersection Observer** - AI taught me how this API works for scroll-based animations.

3. **Form Validation** - I had the logic idea, AI helped me with the regex patterns for email validation.

### Problem Solving

When I got stuck on bugs, I described the issue to Claude and it helped me understand what was wrong.

## 6. Learning Outcomes

### Technical Skills Gained

- **CSS Variables:** How to create a theming system
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox:** Layout techniques for responsive design
- **Async/Await:** Modern JavaScript for API calls
- **Intersection Observer:** Efficient scroll detection
- **LocalStorage API:** Saving user preferences
- **Form Validation:** Real-time input checking

### Soft Skills Developed

- Breaking down complex problems into smaller parts
- Reading and understanding code before using it
- Testing across different devices
- Technical documentation writing

---

## 7. Specific Examples

### Example 1: Theme Toggle

**What I wanted:** A button to switch between light and dark modes

**My approach:** I knew I needed to change CSS somehow when clicking a button

**AI Help:** Showed me how CSS variables work with data attributes

**My implementation:** I adapted the code to match my color scheme and added localStorage to remember the choice

### Example 2: Project Filtering

**What I wanted:** Dropdowns to filter and sort projects

**My approach:** I wrote the HTML for the dropdowns myself

**AI Help:** Helped with the JavaScript array filter() and sort() methods

**My implementation:** I created the project data array with all my projects and tested all filter combinations

### Example 3: GitHub Repos

**What I wanted:** Show my real GitHub repositories

**My approach:** I knew there was a GitHub API but didn't know how to use it

**AI Help:** Explained fetch(), async/await, and error handling

**My implementation:** Changed the username, styled the cards, and added loading states

---

## 8. Code Understanding

I can explain every part of this project because I either wrote it or studied it before using it:

- ✓ How the theme toggle saves to localStorage
- ✓ How project filtering uses array methods
- ✓ How the GitHub API returns repository data
- ✓ How form validation checks each field
- ✓ How Intersection Observer triggers animations
- ✓ How responsive breakpoints adjust the layout

---

## 9. Ethical Considerations

### Why This Is Acceptable

1. **I understand all the code** - I can explain and modify any part
2. **I contributed significantly** - 50% of the work was mine
3. **I'm being transparent** - This report documents AI usage honestly
4. **I learned from it** - The goal was learning, not just getting code

### Academic Integrity

This usage aligns with the course policy on AI tools:

- AI was used as a learning aid
- All code was reviewed and understood
- The project demonstrates my skills and knowledge
- Usage is fully documented

---

## 10. Reflection

### What Worked Well

- AI sped up the initial development
- I learned new techniques faster
- Getting unstuck on problems was easier
- Code quality was generally good

### What I'd Do Differently

- Try to solve problems myself first before asking AI
- Take more notes while learning from AI explanations
- Test more thoroughly as I build, not just at the end

### Future Approach

Going forward, I want to rely less on AI for basic coding and more for learning new concepts. The goal is to strengthen my fundamental skills while using AI as a reference tool.

---

## 11. Conclusion

This project was a collaboration between my own work and AI assistance, split roughly 50/50. I handled the design decisions, content, customization, and testing myself. AI helped with code structure, explaining new concepts, and providing starting points for features I was unfamiliar with.

Most importantly, I understand everything in this project and can explain, modify, or rebuild any part of it. The AI assistance accelerated my learning rather than replacing it.
